### Content

- I followed the course "Boutique Ado" and code for project was lifted from the putting it all together from the [Backend Developenment course from the CODE Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSF_102+Q1_2020/courseware/4201818c00aa4ba3a0dae243725f6e32/d3188bf68530497aa5fba55d07a9d7d7/), 
  Particularly the:

  -  register 
  -  logon 
  -  log off 

  we're lifted directly from the course with just minor amendments to the CSS and html. 

the claims list was mapped accross from the task list. as was the 
- new claim 
- edit and delete feature
- search 

In these particulary cases the code was amended to suite to the requirement of the user stories. 

the email connenction was lifted from the codeinstitute course.
