## Research


## Styling

The chosen font was the one Roy used to design his logo, which was Calibra Light, when I looked to google fonts, I found Open Sans to be most like it, so I elected that as the backup with calibra as the primary font. 

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato&selection.family=Lato&sidebar.open=)

The pen's photographs were provided by Roy, unfortunatley, they aren't the best, this is due to the pens refletive nature, I was able to improve unpon the pictures by filtering out the background, I tried several colours of background but black really made the pens pop! 

Font awesome was used to provide the icons, that really bring the page to life.

### Deployment.

#### Github, Gitpod, Git, Heroku, and Amazon AWS.

- #### Project setup.
 - The project was set up on GitHub using the Code Institue Gitpod Template.
  - I located the template on the Code Institute GitHub page and clicked the use template button.
  - I then named my repository and created it.
  - Once the repository was created I was able to open it with Gitpod.
  - I could then use the terminal to create files and folders and start coding the project.
  - Throughout the project, I used git to add my changes to version control in GitHub.
  - To commit I added the file to the staging area with the 
    ```
        git add <filename>
    ```
    ```
        git commit -m "<commit message>"
    ```
    ```
        git push
    ```


- #### Installing Django
    ```
       pip3 install Django==3.2
    ```
- create project folder

    ```
       django-admin startproject bracken_pen .
    ```

- create file: 

    ```
      touch .gitignore      
    ```

- To run the programe
  ```
    python3 manage.py runserver
  ```

- This should show the install has worked but there will be migrations to take care off. 
  ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
  ```

-It would now be useful to create a super user
  ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

- To enable user function use django allauth
  ```
  pip3 install django-allauth==0.41.0
  ```

  [full allauth documtation](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

- to create a requirement file
  ```
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- to create the alluth templates folder contents
  ```
  cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates/allauth/
  ```



-to add the products section
 
 ```
 python3 manage.py startapp products
 ```

-add the app to setting.py

```
mkdir products/fixtures
```

-to add the bag

```
python3 manage.py startapp bag
```

- to add the checkout section
```
python3 manage.py startapp checkout
```
once the code is written, look to make the migrations.
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
```
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
```
python3 manage.py migrate --plan
```

- crispy forms for checkout
```
pip3 install django-crispy-forms
```

- also a good time to updatethe requirements file
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

-Connecting to Stripe

first create an account with [stripe](https://stripe.com/gb)

remember to confirm it by clicking on the email from Stripe. 

first add their JS to the core js block in the base template.
```
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
</head>
```
then add it to the checkout.html with post block
```
{% block postloadjs %}
    {{ block.super }}
    {{ stripe_public_key|json_script:"id_stripe_public_key" }}
    {{ client_secret|json_script:"id_client_secret" }}
    <script src="{% static 'checkout/js/stripe_elements.js' %}"></script>
{% endblock %}
```

add js to the checkout js
```
/*
    Core logic/payment flow for this comes from here:
    https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment
    CSS from here: 
    https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js
*/

var stripe_public_key = $('#id_stripe_public_key').text().slice(1, -1);
var client_secret = $('#id_client_secret').text().slice(1, -1);
var stripe = Stripe(stripe_public_key);
var elements = stripe.elements();
var style = {
    base: {
        color: '#000',
        fontFamily: '"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif',
        fontSmoothing: 'antialiased',
        fontSize: '16px',
        '::placeholder': {
            color: '#aab7c4'
        }
    },
    invalid: {
        color: '#dc3545',
        iconColor: '#dc3545'
    }
};
var card = elements.create('card', {style: style});
card.mount('#card-element');
```

add css to the css file
```
.StripeElement--focus,
.stripe-style-input:focus,
.stripe-style-input:active {
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px 0 #cfd7df;
}

.StripeElement--webkit-autofill {
  background-color: #fefde5 !important;
}

.stripe-style-input::placeholder {
    color: #aab7c4;
}

.fieldset-label {
    position: relative;
    right: .5rem;
}

#payment-form .form-control,
#card-element {
    color: #000;
    border: 1px solid #000;
}
```

then add the public key to checkout views.py context

then install stripe via the terminal
```
pip3 install stripe
```

import it to view.py



installing countries to checkout. 

```
pip3 install django-countries
```

update 



## Deployement to heroku

log onto [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)

click on create new app. 

name it and click on the region closest to you. 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/newApp.jpg" alt="image of ">

then click on resources, 

in add on type 

```
postgres
```

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/resourcePostgress.jpg">

chose the free plan, 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/freePlan.jpg">


you shoould then see the following:

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/postgreInstalled.jpg">

once that is done go back to gitpod cli and install 

```
pip3 install dj_database_url

```

then install
```
pip3 install psycopg2-binary
```


then freeze requirements. 
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/requirementsTxtView.jpg">


once that is done, goto settings.py in the project folder. 

add 
```
import dj_database_url
```

comment out the default database setting. line circa 119

```
# Database
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#databases

#DATABASES = {
#    'default': {
#        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
#    }
#}
```

Replace it with, 

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(url)
}
```
You'll need to add the database url from heroku, this is found here:

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/configVars.jpg">


Now you'll need to run migrations all over again. 

```
python3 manage.py showmigration
```

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/showMigrations.jpg">


the run

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/mirgate.jpg">

then import product data. 

```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
```

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/loadCategories.jpg">

```
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/loadProducts.jpg">

the is important, categories first then products. 

a side note if you didn't use fixtures. 

```
A note for creating your database if you didn't use fixtures
When you come to follow this process for your milestone project, you may not have used a fixtures file to populate your database like the instructor did.

If this is the case, manually re-creating your database when you come to deploy can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, there is a short process you can follow to download your local mysql database and then upload it to postgres:

Make sure your manage.py file is connected to your mysql database
Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
Connect your manage.py file to your postgres database
Then use this command to load your data from the db.json file into postgres:
python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
```

Now create the super user
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

you now need to delete the heroku database config from setting.py, circa line 133, then uncomment the original. 

wrap that in the following if statement. 

```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```

now install unicorn. this will act as the webserver. 
```
pip3 install gunicorn
```

then freeze that into the requirement's file.
```
pip3 freeze> requirements.txt
```

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/gunicorn.jpg">

now create a Procfile right click on explorer, create file, note not .ext ! 

```
Procfile
```

enter the following into the file. 
```
web: gunicorn bracken_pen.wsgi:application
```

now log onto Herokku in the CLI. 

```
heroku login -i 
```

use your eamil address and your api key from heroku. 

next type
```
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app bracken-pen-turner
```

add host name to settings.py 

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['bracken-pen-turner.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```

then do a git add, commit and push. 

you'll then need to push to heroku, you might need to log into Heruko in the CLI, type


```
git push heroku main
```

click on the link and you should be taken to your partially deployed site. 

Next you'll need to link Heruko to you gitHub, 

click setting, then click on deployment method gitHub, search for the rep. click connect. then click deploy. 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/linkToGitHUB.jpg">


Now update the secret_key. 

use a website to generate a django secret key

[django-secret-key-generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)

in settings.py

swtich out the old "secret key"

SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-pgtktu*4v+^$84ik@04!2qvq6l-c!migq37yk9^8lswml2iwhu'

with this 
```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
```

## AWS - s3 - simple storgae service. 

log on to AWS (you may need to create and account, you'll need a credit card too, but things should stay below the free tarif.)

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

once signed up, log in and goto the AWS Management Console. 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/AWSControl.jpg">

then search for S3. and click on create a bucket. 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/createABucket.jpg">

enter a name, "bracken-pen-turner"

select a region closest to you. 


<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/bucketNameRegion.jpg">


un click "Block all public access" and acknowledge access will be public.

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/accessPublic.jpg">


then click "create bucket"

The click on the newly created bucket. 

open properties. 


then enable static website hosting

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/StaticWebHosting.jpg">

Next click on Permissions. 

Scroll to CORS, enter the following

```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [

      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```
<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/CORSPolicy.jpg">

Still under permissions click on bucket policy, 

Click on policy generator

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/PolicyGenerator.jpg">


set type of policy to "S3 Bucket Policy"

Alow all principles by entering a *

the action "getObjet"

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/Policy1.jpg">


the copy the ARN from the edit policy page, 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/Policy2.jpg">

to here

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/Policy3.jpg">

Then click "Add Statement"

Then click "Generate Policy"

Copy the generated policy. 
<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/Policy4.jpg">

then click import manage policy, 

search for S3, click on the AmanzonS3FullAccess

then click import


<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/Import1.jpg">

Now we don't want full access to everthing, just our new bucket, so we need to get the buck ARN from the S3. 

copy and paste this in to the JSON, thus:
<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/policyARN.jpg">

click Next:Tags tags are optional but do click to get to review policy. 

On the review policy page give it a name and a description then click create policy. 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/createPolicy.jpg">

this takes as back to the policy page.

We now need to attach it to the group we created. 

go back to user groups, click on permissions, click on add permissions. The policy you just created should be at the top, if not search for the name you gave it. then click "Add permissions"

We now need to craete a User, click on User. then Add user. 

give them a user name, and programatic access. 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/addUse1.jpg">

click next. 

We can now put them in our group. Just click the group. (note the policy is attached to the group)

you can click through to the next 2 screens, then click "Create user".

Now download the .CSV file. 
This contains the access key and secret access key. 

-Connecting Django to the S3 Bucket

first install two new packages in the commange line 

```
pip3 install boto3
```

and 
```
pip3 install django-storages
```

then freeze them into the text file. 

```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

you'll need to add storages to our installed app

in setting.py add 

```
'storages',
```

next add the following to the settings.py crica line 178. 

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'bracken-pen-turner'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```

### Linking Django to s3 bucket

createa a file 
```
custom_storages.py
```

enther the following code. 

```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

when you push this to git, it should result in heruko building the app and the website delpoying. with all the static files. 



optional, add this code to setting.py to cache static files for long periods. it should help to improve the performance of the site.

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }
```


### To join the media files to the S3 bucket. 

go to S3, 

click on your bucket

then click add folder

name the folder media

upload photos to that media, select the photos you want to add.

make sure "grant public permission to access this object" is selected. 

The click upload.



### Adding Stripe to Heroku

in stripe log and and go to developers then the API Keys. 

Copy of the Publishable KEY and and Secret Key, 

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/StripeKeyApi.jpg">


#### Webhook Endpoint. 

Still in Stripe we need to add a new webhook endpoint. 
just under API, click Webhooks, click add endpoint. 

copy the heroku URL add, /checkout/wh/

<img src="https://github.com/whatnote/BrackenPenTurner/blob/main/ReadMePics/deployement/weebhookEndPoint.jpg">

add all listening events. 

click add endpoint. 

now add the webhook signing secret to Heroku, in the congig Vars. (see above for this)

Note, the Config Vars names need to match that in the settings.py. 


### Emails

This is most easily acheived with a gmail account. 

log on to your gmail account/ set one up; go to settings.

now you have the app password, copy it and enter it into Heroku's variable. 

variable is:
```
EMAIL_HOST_PASS
```

then paste the code. 

also enter, 

```
EMAIL_HOST_USER
```

then enter the email address. s

Now you need to haed over to setting.py and amend some info there. 

line 107 , delete 

```
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```


then at the bottom, add
```
if 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'brackenpenturners@gmail.com'
else:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
